# Assignment 6

## Description

exploring the uses of classes through creation of a mortgage management software

File is written to handle batch data for mortgage calculations, combing through the file to find exceptions as well

## Challenges

I found that understanding the purpose of accessors in python difficult to grasp
I also found the order that we needed to write code and commit without asserts was difficult and required me to at times
go further into the assignment in order for tests to no longer cause assert such as requiring all the getter and setters before
args wouldn't be insufficient. This may mean that the required number of commits isn't met
